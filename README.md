# CS291A Website

## Developing

In order to develop the website you will need one tool: jekyll

Jekyll is a ruby gem that generates websites from markdown. To install it and
its dependencies run:

    bundle

To develop locally run:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

## Publishing

Push updates or merge a pull request to the master branch and CircleCI will
take care of the rest.
