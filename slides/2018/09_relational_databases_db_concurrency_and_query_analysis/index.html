# Relational Databases: Concurrency Control and Query Analysis

__CS291A__

Dr. Bryce Boe

October 25, 2018

---

# Today's Agenda

* TODO

* Relational Databases Motivation

* A Stable Data Layer

* Database Concurrency Control

* Query Analysis

---

# TODO

## Should be done

* Chapters 1-2, 9-11 in
  [HPBN](https://hpbn.co/primer-on-latency-and-bandwidth/) / All Chapters in
  the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning)

* TravisCI integration with your repository.

* Web application with a handful of basic and more complex features.

* Successfully deployed your application to AWS.

---

# Relational Databases

After today you should...

* understand the importance of relational databases in architecting scalable
  Internet systems

--

* understand how to design with concurrency in mind

--

* have a basic idea regarding how to speed up your data layer

    * determining where to start

    * using rails-specific techniques

    * being able to identity the source of slowness in a SQL query

---

# Stateful Requests

.left-column[
We have many stateless application servers responding to requests.

Clients can be served by any application servers.

Client requests regularly include data updates.
]
.right-column[
![Database connectivity](app_server_to_database.png)
]

---

# Application Server _Needs_

.left-column[
* Data needs to be shared between requests and servers

* Access to data shouldn't be slow

* High availability of shared data

* Utilizing the data layer should be intuitive:

```ruby
if david.balance > 100
  david.withdrawal(100)
  mary.deposit(100)
end
```
]
.right-column[
![Database connectivity](app_server_to_database.png)
]

---

# Data Layer Options

.left-column[
There are quite a few existing solutions for a _stable_ data layer.

## Relational (SQL)

* MySQL (MariaDB, Percona)
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* MS SQL

## Non-relational (NoSQL)

* Cassandra
* MongoDB
* Redis
]
.right-column[
![Database connectivity](app_server_to_database.png)
]

---

# SQL v. NoSQL

.left-column[
## Relational Databases...

* are a general-purpose persistence layer
* offer more features
* have a limited ability to scale horizontally

## Non-relational Databases...

* often are more specialized
* require more from the application layer
* are better at scaling horizontally

If your needs fit within a RDBMS's (relational database management system)
ability to scale, they tend to be best. If your scaling needs exceed RDBMS
capabilities, go non-relational.

# Database Outline

.left-column[
## Today we will discuss:

* Relational databases
* Concurrency control
* SQL query analysis

## Later we will discuss:

* Scaling options for relational databases:
    * Sharding
    * Service Oriented Architectures (SOA)
    * Distinguishing reads from writes
* A survey of NoSQL options

# Database Transactions

Transactions are a database concept that allows a system to guarantee certain
semantic properties.

Transactions provide control over concurrency.

Having rigorously defined guarantees means we can build correct systems using
these databases.

---

# Database Transaction History

## Mid 1970's, IBM System R's Research Storage System (RSS)

* First system to implement SQL
* Introduced formal notions of transactions and serializability

Jim Gray (1998 Turing Award Winner) had a significant role in the project for
the introduction of transactions.

---

# Database ACID Properties

__Atomicity__

* Complete everything, or do nothing
* No partial application of a transaction

--

__Consistency__

* The database should be consistent both at the beginning and end of a
  transaction
* Consistency is defined by the integrity constraints (e.g., foreign keys, `NOT
  NULL`, etc.)

--

__Isolation__

* A transaction should not see the effects of other uncommitted transactions

--

__Durability__

* Once committed, the transaction's effects should not disappear

---

# Overlapping Concerns

__Atomicity__ and __Durability__ are related and are generally provided by
_journaling_.

__Consistency__ and __Isolation__ are provided by concurrency control (usually
implemented via locking).

---

# Definition: Schedule

A __schedule__ is an abstract model used to describe the execution of
transactions that run in a database.


| T1     | T2     | T3     |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| R(X)   |        |        |
| W(X)   |        |        |
| Commit |        |        |
|        | R(Y)   |        |
|        | W(Y)   |        |
|        | Commit |        |
|        |        | R(Z)   |
|        |        | W(Z)   |
|        |        | Commit |

---

# Conflicting Actions

Two actions are said to be in conflict if:

* the actions belong to different transactions

* at least one of the actions is a write operation

* the actions access the same object (read or write)

## Conflicting Actions

| T1     | T2     | T3     |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| R(X)   |        |        |
|        | W(X)   |        |
|        |        | W(X)   |

---

# Non-Conflicting Examples

## All reads

| T1     | T2     | T3     |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| R(X)   |        |        |
|        | R(X)   |        |
|        |        | R(X)   |

--

## Write to different object

| T1     | T2     | T3     |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| R(X)   |        |        |
|        | W(Y)   |        |
|        |        | R(X)   |

---

# Question

> Can we blindly execute transactions in parallel?

--

# Answer

__No__

* Dirty Read Problem

* Incorrect Summary Problem

---

# Dirty Read Problem

A transaction (T2) reads a value written by another transaction (T1) that is
later _aborted_ (its actions are rolled back).

The result of the T2 transaction will put the database in an incorrect state.

| T1     | T2     |
|:------:|:------:|
| W(X)   |        |
|        | R(X)   |
| Abort  |        |
|        | W(Y)   |
|        | Commit |

---

# Incorrect Summary Problem

A transaction (T1) computes a summary over the values of all the instances of a
repeated data-item. While that occurs, another transaction (T2) updates some
instances of data-item.

The resulting summary will not reflect a correct result for any deterministic
order of the transactions (T1 then T2, or T2 then T1).

| T1     | T2     |
|:------:|:------:|
| R(X*)  |        |
| R(X*)  | W(X^n) |
| R(X*)  | Commit |
| R(X*)  |        |
| W(Y)   |        |
| Commit |        |

---

# Schedule Types

## A schedule is _serial_ if

* the transactions are executed non-interleaved

## Two schedules are _conflict equivalent_ if

* they involve the same set of transactions
* every pair of conflicting actions are ordered in the same way

## A schedule is _conflict serializable_ if

* the schedule is __conflict equivalent__ to a __serial__ schedule

## A schedule is _recoverable_ if

* transactions commit only after all transactions whose changes they read,
  commit

---

# Why Serializable?

.left-column[
> Why is it important that we have a serializable schedule?

> Why not simply execute serially?
]
.right-column[
![Database connectivity](app_server_to_database.png)
]

---

# Serial Schedule

Having a serial schedule is important for consistent results. For example it is
good when you are keeping track of your bank balance in the database.

A serial execution of transactions is safe but _slow_.

Most general purpose relational databases default to employing
conflict-serializable and recoverable schedules.

> How do these RDBMS employ conflict-serializable and recoverable schedules?

---

# Database Locks

In order to implement a database whose schedules are both conflict serializable
and recoverable locks are used.

* A lock is a system object associated with a shared resource such as a data
  item, a row, or a page in memory.

* A database lock may need to be acquired by a transaction before accessing the
  object.

* Locks prevent undesired, incorrect, or inconsistent operations on shared
resources by concurrent transactions.

---

# Types of Database Locks

## Write-lock

* Blocks writes and reads

* Also called __exclusive lock__

--

## Read-lock

* Blocks writes

* Also called __shared lock__ (other reads can happen concurrently)

---

# Two-Phase Locking

Two-phase locking (2PL) is a concurrency control method that guarantees
serializability.

The two phases are:

* Acquire Locks

* Release Locks

--

## Two-phase locking Protocol

* Each transaction must obtain a _shared_ lock on an object before __reading__.

* Each transaction must obtain an _exclusive_ lock on an object before
  __writing__.

* If a transaction holds an exclusive lock on an object, no other transaction
  can obtain any lock on that object.

* A transaction cannot request additional locks once it releases any locks.

---

# Two-Phase Locking: Potential Issue

During the second phase locks can be released as soon as they are no longer
needed. This permits other transactions to obtain those locks.

| T1        | T2     |
|:---------:|:------:|
| R(A)      |        |
| W(A)      |        |
| unlock(A) |        |
|           | R(A)   |
| ...       | ...    |
| abort     |        |

--

> What happens to T2 when T1 aborts the transaction?

---

# Strong Strict Two-Phase Locking

2PL can result in cascading aborts.

SS2PL allows only conflict serializable schedules.

--

# Strong Strict Two-Phase Locking Protocol

* Each transaction must obtain a _shared_ lock on an object before __reading__.

* Each transaction must obtain an _exclusive_ lock on an object before
__writing__.

* If a transaction holds an exclusive lock on an object, no other transaction
  can obtain any lock on that object.
* __All locks held by a transaction are released when the transaction
  completes.__

This approach avoids the problem with cascading aborts.

--

> What is the downside to SS2PL?

# Concurrency Control in Rails

.left-column[
We have many application servers running our application.

We are using a relational database to ensure that each request observes a
consistent view of the database.

> What is required in rails to obtain this consistency?
]
.right-column[
![Database connectivity](app_server_to_database.png)
]


---

# Concurrency Control in Rails

Rails uses two types of concurrency control:

## Optimistic Locking

Assume that database modifications are going to succeed. Throw an exception
when they do not.

--

## Pessimistic Locking

Ensure that database modifications will succeed by explicitly avoiding
conflict.

---

# Optimistic Locking in Rails

Any ActiveRecord model will automatically utilize optimistic locking if an
integer `lock_version` field is added to the object's table.

Whenever such an ActiveRecord object is read from the database, that object
contains its associated `lock_version`.

When an update for the object occurs, Rails compares the object's
`lock_version` to the most recent one in the database.

--

If they differ a `StaleObjectException` is thrown.

Otherwise, the data is written to the database, and the `lock_version` value is
incremented.

--

This optimistic locking is an application-level construct. The database does
nothing more than storing the `lock_version` values.

---

# Optimistic Locking Example

```ruby
c1 = Child.find(1)
c1.gender = "male"

c2 = Child.find(1)
c2.gender = "female"

c1.save!  # Succeeds (It's a boy!)
c2.save!  # throws StaleObjectException
```

--

## Strengths

* Predictable performance
* Lightweight

--

## Weaknesses

* Have to write error handling code
* (or) errors will propagate to your users

---

# Pessimistic Locking in Rails

Easily done by calling `lock` along with ActiveRecord `find`.

Whenever an ActiveRecord object is read from the database with that option an
exclusive lock is acquired for the object.

While this lock is held, the database prevents others from obtaining the lock,
reading from, and writing to the object. The others are blocked until the
object is unlocked.

Implemented using the `SELECT FOR UPDATE` SQL.

---

# Pessimistic Locking Example

Request 1

```ruby
transaction do
  c1 = Child.find(1).lock(true)
  c1.name = 'Daniel'
  c1.save!  # works fine
end
```

Request 2

```ruby
transaction do
  c2 = Child.find(1).lock(true)
  c2.name = 'Delaney'
  c2.save!  # works fine
end
```

This approach works great, yet it is not commonly used.

> What could go wrong?

---

# Pessimistic Locking Issue 1

> What could go wrong? (blocking)

Request 1

```ruby
transaction do
  c1 = Child.find(1).lock(true)
  c1.name = 'Daniel'
* my_long_procedure
  c1.save!
end
```

Request 2

```ruby
transaction do
  c2 = Child.find(1).lock(true)
  c2.name = 'Delaney'
  c2.save!
end
```

---

# Pessimistic Locking: Deadlock

Request 1

```ruby
transaction do
* fam = Family.find(3).lock(true)
  c1 = Child.find(1).lock(true)
  c1.name = 'Daniel'
  c1.save!
* fam.count += 1
* fam.save!
end
```

Request 2

```ruby
transaction do
  c2 = Child.find(1).lock(true)
  c2.name = 'Delaney'
  c2.save!
* fam = Family.find(3).lock(true)
* fam.count += 1
* fam.save!
end
```

---

# Pessimistic Locking: Summary

## Strengths

* Failed transactions are incredibly rare or nonexistent

--

## Weaknesses

* Have to worry about deadlocks and avoiding them

* Performance is less predictable

---

# Challenge 1

> Which form of locking would you choose?

```ruby
transaction do
  determine_auction_winner()
  send_email_to_winner()
  save_auction_outcome()
end
```

--

# Challenge 2

> Which form of locking would you choose?

```ruby
transaction do
  record_facebook_like()
  update_global_counter_of_all_likes_ever()
end
```

---

# Next Step

We now have a Rails app connected to MySQL and it is slower than you'd
like.

You think the bottleneck may be the database.

> How do we find out?

---

# Demo App Database Optimizations

.left-column30[
Let's use an example from the Demo app!

By changing the way you interact with the Rails ORM (ActiveRecord) you can
significantly improve performance.

The following examples are all contained in the _database_optimizations_ branch
on github.
]
.right-column70[
![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)
]

---

# Demo App ActiveRecord Time

.left-column30[
With the Demo app's _master_ branch deployed on a `m3_medium` instance
with:

* 20 Communities
* 400 Submissions
* 8000 Comments

A request to `/` resulted in:

Completed 200 OK
ActiveRecord: 220.6ms.

> Why so slow?
]
.right-column70[
![Submissions Index View](demo_submissions_index.png)
]

---

# Demo App Investigation

__First Step__: Find out what Rails is doing.

In _development_ mode, Rails will output the SQL it generates and executes to
the application server log.

To (temporarily) enable this in _production_ mode, change
`config/environments/production.rb` to contain:

```ruby
config.log_level = :debug
```

---

# Submission Index Controller and View

Controller

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @submissions = Submission.all
  end
end
```

View

```erb
<% @submissions.each do |submission| %>
  <tr>
    <td><%= link_to(submission.title, submission.url) %></td>
    <td><%= submission.url %></td>
    <td><%= submission.community.name %></td>
    <td>
      <%= link_to("#{submission.comments.size} comments",
                  submission, class: 'btn btn-primary btn-xs') %>
    </td>
  </tr>
<% end %>
```

---

# Generated SQL Statements

```
Processing by SubmissionsController#index as HTML
Submission Load (0.5ms)  SELECT `submissions`.* FROM `submissions`
Community Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  `communities`.* FROM `communities` WHERE `communities`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `comments` WHERE `comments`.`submission_id` = 1
SELECT  `communities`.* FROM `communities` WHERE `communities`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]]
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `comments` WHERE `comments`.`submission_id` = 2
SELECT  `communities`.* FROM `communities` WHERE `communities`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]]
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `comments` WHERE `comments`.`submission_id` = 3
SELECT  `communities`.* FROM `communities` WHERE `communities`.`id` = 1 LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]]
...
SELECT  `communities`.* FROM `communities` WHERE `communities`.`id` = 20 LIMIT 1  [["id", 20]]
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `comments` WHERE `comments`.`submission_id` = 400
```

--

## That is a lot of `SELECT` queries!

---

# Number of Queries Bottleneck

We are issuing a ton of `SELECT` queries. The overhead associated with each is
slowing us down.

> How can we fix this problem?

--

## Issue fewer queries.

* Do not ask for the community each time

* Do not ask for the number of comments each time

---

# Reducing Queries in Rails

(__Before__) Without `includes`

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @submissions = Submission.all
  end
end
```

--

(__After__) With `includes`

```ruby
class SubmissionsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @submissions = Submission.includes(:comments)

# SQL Explain

Sometimes things are still slow even when you have minimized the number of
queries.

SQL provides an `EXPLAIN` statement that can be used to analyze individual
queries.

When a query starts with `EXPLAIN`...

* the query is not actually executed

* the produced output will help us identify potential improvements

---

# MySQL Explain Example

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `submissions`.`id`) FROM `submissions`
JOIN `comments` WHERE `comments`.`submission_id` = `submissions`.`id`
AND `comments`.`message` = 'This is not a test!'\G
 *************************** 1. row ***************************
id: 1
select_type: SIMPLE
table: submissions
type: index
possible_keys: PRIMARY
key: index_submissions_on_community_id
key_len: 5
ref: NULL
rows: 50
Extra: Using index
*************************** 2. row ***************************
id: 1

# Understanding the Explain Output

The following are the most important fields for performance analysis:

| Field         | Meaning                            |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------|
| select_type   | The SELECT type                    |
| type          | The join type                      |
| possible_keys | The indexes available to be chosen |
| key           | The index actually chosen          |
| rows          | Estimate number of rows to examine |

# MySQL Explain Field: select_type

`select_type` indicates the type of select statement being performed.

Most types are fine, but two indicate potential performance problems:

* __Dependent Subquery__: reevaluated for every different value of the outer
  query
* __Uncacheable Subquery__: reevaluated for every value of the outer query

---

# MySQL Explain Field: type

`type` indicates the type of JOIN being used. From best to worst:

* __system__: The table only has one row
* __const__: From uniqueness, we know only one row can match
* __eq_ref__, __ref__: Only one row at most can match from the previous table
* __fulltext__: MySQL fulltext index
* __ref_or_null__: Like ref, but also includes _NULL_ values
* __index_merge__: Uses multiple indexes to obtain the result
* __unique_subquery__
* __index_subquery__
* __range__: Only rows in a given range are retrieved, but can use index
* __index__: Full table scan, but can scan index instead of actual table
* __ALL__: Full table scan

# MySQL Explain Fields: possible_keys &amp; key

`possible_keys` lists the indexes that could possibly be used to perform the
query. `key` indicates which key was actually chosen to perform the query.

If you don't like the index that the database is using, you can tell it to
ignore the index by adding `IGNORE INDEX` to the query.

When `possible_keys` is NULL, it's very likely one or more indexes should be
added to the appropriate columns.

---

# MySQL Explain Field: rows

The `rows` field indicates the database's estimate of how many rows may need
to be read to perform the query.

The larger the number, the more time the query will take.

---

# SQL Optimizations

There are three primary ways to optimize SQL queries:

* Add or modify indexes

* Modify the table structure

* Directly optimize the query

---

# SQL Indexes

> What is an index?

An index is a fast, ordered, compact structure (B-tree) for identifying row
locations.

When an index is provided on a column that is to be filtered (searching for a
particular item), the database is able to quickly find that information.

Indexes can exist on a single column, or across multiple columns. Multi-column
indexes are useful when filtering on two columns (e.g., CS classes that are not
full).

---

# Adding Indexes in Rails

To add an index on the `name` field of the `Product` table, create a migration
containing:

```ruby
class AddNameIndexProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_index :products, :name
  end
end
```

---

# Related: Foreign Keys

By default, when dealing with relationships between ActiveRecord objects, Rails
will validate the constraints in the application layer.

For example, an `Employee` object should have a `Company` that they work for.

Assuming the relationship is defined properly, Rails will enforce that when
creating an `Employee`, the associated `Company` exists.

Many databases, have built-in support for enforcing such constraints. With
rails, one can also take advantage of the database's foreign key support via
[add_foreign_key](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#foreign-keys).

```ruby
class AddForeignKeyToOrders < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_foreign_key :employees, :companies
  end
end
```

---

# Optimize the Table Structure

Indexes work best when they can be kept in memory.

Sometimes changing the field type, or index length can provide significant
memory savings.

If appropriate some options are:

* Reduce the length of a VARCHAR index if appropriate

* Use a smaller unsigned integer type

* Use an integer or enum field for statuses rather than a text-based value

---

# Directly Optimize the Query

Before

```sql
explain select count(*) from txns where parent_id - 1600 = 16340;

select_type: SIMPLE
table: txns
type: index
key: index_txns_on_reverse_txn_id
rows: 439186
Extra: Using where; Using index
```

--

After

```sql
explain select count(*) from txns where parent_id = 16340 + 1600

select_type: SIMPLE
table: txns
type: const
key: index_txns_on_reverse_txn_id
rows: 1
Extra: Using index
```
